Author - Henry Schneiderman, henry@pittdata.com

Implemented using PyTorch.

Conda environment setup (installs all Python packages needed by the software in this directory): conda create -n myenv â€“file package_list.txt

train_network.py - Trains neural network
evaluate_network.py - Test and analyze accuracy of a trained network
data_generation.py - Fetches and preprocesses data for training and testing
network_losses.py - Loss functions for training and testing (e.g., loss per atmospheric layer, clear sky, geographic location)
